# Work for Pivotal Life Sciences
## January - May 2024

During my internship at Pivotal Life Sciences, I worked on enhancing DeepFRI, a deep learning model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) networks with graph convolutional networks (GCN) to predict protein functions. My role involved data cleaning, feature selection, and in-depth analysis using Python libraries like TensorFlow and Biopython. Ultimately, I modified DeepFRI and develop complementary functions that increased its utility for Pivotal Life Sciences' investment team. At the end of my internship, I presented my findings to both UC Berkeley faculty and peers, as well as the Pivotal Life Sciences team.
